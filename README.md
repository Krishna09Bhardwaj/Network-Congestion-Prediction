# Network Congestion Analysis Project

## Overview
This project provides comprehensive data analysis and machine learning modeling for network congestion prediction using a variety of performance metrics. The system analyzes patterns in network traffic to identify factors contributing to congestion and develops models to predict congestion levels.

## Author
**Krishna Bhardwaj**

## Dataset
The Network Congestion Dataset contains detailed metrics collected from network nodes across various regions. The dataset includes:

- **Packet Loss Rate**: The percentage of packets that fail to reach their destination
- **Average Latency**: Time delay in milliseconds for packet transmission
- **Node Betweenness Centrality**: A measure of a node's importance in network topology
- **Traffic Volume**: Data throughput in MBps
- **Link Stability Score**: Reliability metric for network connections
- **Regional Information**: Geographic classification of network nodes
- **Administrative Contact**: Management information
- **Temporal Data**: Timestamps for trend analysis
